# To-Done

An app that allows you to easily keep track of the things you need to get done. The data will be saved so that your to-dos will not go missing. Simply type in your to-do and hit 'Enter' or press the '+' button to add your to-do. Once your to-done is to-done, click the 'done' button! It's that easy.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
