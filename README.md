# To-Done

An app that allows you to easily keep track of the things you need to get done. The data will be saved so that your to-dos will not go missing. Simply type in your to-do and hit 'Enter' or press the '+' button to add your to-do. Once your to-done is to-done, click the 'done' button!

**It's that easy.**

All of the Javascript was coded in Visual Studio Code by yours truly. Built with HTML, CSS, & React.JS. Deployed with Netlify [here](https://todonebyzack.netlify.app/). All text is of the [Geist Mono typeface](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geist+Mono).

Many thanks to smoljames for his [fantastic course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKpkVKubvKk&ab_channel=Smoljames) and for his starter HTML/CSS code for this project.

#### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
